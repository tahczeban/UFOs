***RESOURCES*** JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, D3.js, VSC, NASA website.




***OVERVIEW***
The purpose of this challenge was to help Dana build an HTML page,  access information from a JS data.js file, stored as an array, and to create an interactive website to search UFO sightings. In order to create the HTML webpage, the following had to be completed: 
1. remove list element creating the button
2. replace the handleclick() function to save element, value and ID of the altered filter 
3. create a new function that loops through the dataset and only keeps data per the search criteria
4. create empty filters variable, replace handleclick() with updateFilters()
5. add filterTable() to filter the table value with entered values
6. listen for events so that it detects a change and calls the updateFilters() function, which saves the      element, value and ID of the filter
7. use D3.select() to save the element changed
8. write if-else statements to check if value was changed
9. clear element from filters variable
10. create and code for a filterTable() function
11. loop through and store the data matching the filters value
12. incorporate both for interactive table

***SUMMARY***

drawback:if specifics unknown

The two recommendations for improving the website are:
1. filter a range of dates, as it is difficult to know exact date of sighting

2. how criteria is typed
